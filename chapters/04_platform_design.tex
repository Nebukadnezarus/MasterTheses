\chapter{Platform Design}\label{chapter:platform-design}

We design an aerodynamic surface-enhanced quadrotor in X-wing configuration to preserve multirotor agility while benefiting from passive lift in forward flight.

\section{Configuration and layout}
- Quadrotor X configuration with integrated fixed wings (X-shaped planform) aligned with the rotor arms.
- Structural considerations: wing aspect ratio, sweep/dihedral, stiffness, and mounting relative to CoG and rotor thrust lines.
- Sensors and avionics: IMU, FC/ESCs, Jetson companion, motion capture (Vicon) for ground-truth.

\section{Wing and aerodynamic surface choices}
- Select planform and airfoil balancing lift at operational Reynolds numbers with low added mass.
- Wing area and placement trade-offs: lift vs. added drag and control cross-coupling; ensure propeller inflow interactions are manageable.

\section{Propulsion and actuation}
- Motor-propeller pair sized for required thrust-to-weight and agility margins (e.g., 3g lateral load tracking).
- Thrust and torque maps: throttle-to-RPM and RPM-to-thrust/torque characterization to support control allocation.
