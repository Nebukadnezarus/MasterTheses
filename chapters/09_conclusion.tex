\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

We summarize contributions: design of an aerodynamic surface-enhanced quadrotor, a robust INDI-based tracking controller, and experimental validation demonstrating accurate agile tracking and improved forward-flight efficiency. We outline future work, including refined aerodynamic modeling, coordinated-turn guidance integration, and extended outdoor testing.
